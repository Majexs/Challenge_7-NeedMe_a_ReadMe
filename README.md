# Module 7 Challenge - NeedMe a ReadMe
## Description
This is a weekly challenge for the Engineering Bootcamp. It uses node.js to create prompts for the user, which will then generate a fully marked down README file. In fact, this README itself was created using the application!
## Installation
Through npm, the user will need to install fs to create files and inquirer to allow for prompts and responses.
## Usage
Please see the accompanying video in the link below. A sample README will be created (which is included in this repo).
